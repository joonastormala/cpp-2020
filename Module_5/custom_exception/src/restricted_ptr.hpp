/* 
 * Copy your implementation from the last round here (or wait for
 * the example answer to come out and copy that) and wrap it inside a 
 * WeirdMemoryAllocator namespace.
 * 
 * Changes to the class:
 * 
 * Add a new member string to store the use of the RestrictedPtr 
 * and add a new string parameter, which is the use of the pointer, to the 
 * constructor that originally only takes a pointer. Remember to modify
 * copying to also copy the use. If the pointer is automatically set to 
 * a nullptr (i.e. not given in the constructor), the use is "nullptr".
 * 
 * The copy constructor and assigment operators should throw a RestrictedCopyException 
 * if the operations fail (as they in some cases should). When the copying
 * fails, only the exception should be thrown and no changes should be made
 * to the existing pointer.
 * 
 * The GetData function should throw a RestrictedNullException with the use
 * of the RestrictedPtr given to it if the pointer is null.
 * 
 * The class shouldn't leak any memory.
